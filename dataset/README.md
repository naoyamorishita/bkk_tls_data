# Background Map of Timor Leste & Bangkok
This dataset will primarily serve as a background map for our upcoming experiment. The dataset includes landcovers both from MODIS and Sentinel, segments, infrastructrue, land use (Bangkok Data only), and water extent. The original datasets derived from OpenStreetMap, OvertureMaps, MODIS, and WorldCover were modified (e.g., dissolve, vectorize, and clip) by the authors.
